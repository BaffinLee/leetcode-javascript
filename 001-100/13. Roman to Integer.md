## Problem

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: ```I```, ```V```, ```X```, ```L```, ```C```, ```D``` and ```M```.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as ```II``` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, ```XII```, which is simply ```X``` + ```II```. The number twenty seven is written as ```XXVII```, which is ```XX``` + ```V``` + ```II```.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not ```IIII```. Instead, the number four is written as ```IV```. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ```IX```. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- ```I``` can be placed before ```V``` (5) and ```X``` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- ```X``` can be placed before ```L``` (50) and ```C``` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- ```C``` can be placed before ```D``` (500) and ```M``` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: C = 100, L = 50, XXX = 30 and III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var romanToInt = function(s) {
  var map = {
    I: 1,
    IV: 4,
    V: 5,
    IX: 9,
    X: 10,
    XL: 40,
    L: 50,
    XC: 90,
    C: 100,
    CD: 400,
    D: 500,
    CM: 900,
    M: 1000
  };
  var len = s.length;
  var i = 0;
  var res = 0;
  while (i < len) {
    if (map[s.substr(i, 2)]) {
      res += map[s.substr(i, 2)];
      i += 2;
    } else {
      res += map[s[i]];
      i += 1;
    }
  }
  return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
