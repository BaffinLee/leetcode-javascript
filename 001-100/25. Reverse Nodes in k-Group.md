# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

- Difficulty: Hard.
- Related Topics: Linked List.

## Problem

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list **k** at a time and return its modified list.

**k** is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of **k** then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**

Given this linked list: ```1->2->3->4->5```

For **k** = 2, you should return: ```2->1->4->3->5```

For **k** = 3, you should return: ```3->2->1->4->5```

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var reverseKGroup = function(head, k) {
  if (!head || k < 2) return head;
  
  var count = 0;
  var now = head;
  var last = head;
  var tmp = null;
  
  while (now && count < k) {
    now = now.next;
    count++;
  }
  
  if (count === k) {
    now = reverseKGroup(now, k);
    while (count-- > 0) {
      tmp = last.next;
      last.next = now;
      now = last;
      last = tmp;
    }
    last = now;
  }
  
  return last;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
