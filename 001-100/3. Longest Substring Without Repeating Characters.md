## Problem

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Examples:**

Given ```"abcabcbb"```, the answer is ```"abc"```, which the length is 3.

Given ```"bbbbb"```, the answer is ```"b"```, with the length of 1.

Given ```"pwwkew"```, the answer is ```"wke"```, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a **substring**, ```"pwke"``` is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  var map = {};
  var len = s.length;
  var max = 0;
  var start = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (map[s[i]] !== undefined) {
      start = Math.max(start, map[s[i]] + 1);
    }
    map[s[i]] = i;
    max = Math.max(max, i - start + 1);
  }
  return max;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
