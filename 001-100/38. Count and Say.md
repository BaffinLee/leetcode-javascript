## Problem

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

```1``` is read off as ```"one 1"``` or ```11```.
```11``` is read off as ```"two 1s"``` or ```21```.
```21``` is read off as ```"one 2```, then ```one 1"``` or ```1211```.

Given an integer *n*, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string}
 */
var countAndSay = function(n) {
  var str = '1';
  var tmp = '';
  var last = '';
  var count = 0;
  var len = 0;
	
  for (var i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    tmp = '';
    last = '';
    count = 0;
    len = str.length;
			
    for (var j = 0; j < len; j++) {
      if (last === '') {
        last = str[j];
        count = 1;
        continue;
      }
      if (str[j] === last) {
        count += 1;
      } else {
        tmp += '' + count + last;
        last = str[j];
        count = 1;
      }
    }
    
    if (last) {
      tmp += '' + count + last;
    }
			
    str = tmp;
  }
	
  return str;
};
```
