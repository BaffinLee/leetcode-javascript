## Problem

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a **m** x **n** grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as ```1``` and ```0``` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** **m** and **n** will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} obstacleGrid
 * @return {number}
 */
var uniquePathsWithObstacles = function(obstacleGrid) {
  var m = obstacleGrid.length;
  var n = (obstacleGrid[0] || []).length;
  var dp = Array(m);
  var left = 0;
  var top = 0;

  if (!m || !n) return 0;
  
  for (var i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    dp[i] = Array(n);
    for (var j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      left = (j === 0 || obstacleGrid[i][j - 1] === 1) ? 0 : dp[i][j - 1];
      top = (i === 0 || obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] === 1) ? 0 : dp[i - 1][j];
      dp[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i][j] === 1 ? 0 : ((i === 0 && j === 0) ? 1 : (left + top));
    }
  }
  
  return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
};
```

**Explain:**

`dp[i][j]` 代表到达该点的路径数量。该点可以从左边点或上边点到达
也就是 `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]`。

考虑特殊情况：

1. 该点为障碍，`dp[i][j] = 0`;
2. 左边点为障碍或不存在，`left = 0`;
3. 上边点点为障碍或不存在，`top = 0`;
4. 左边点与上边点均不存在，即起点，`dp[i][j] = 1`;

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(m*n).
* Space complexity : O(m*n).
