## Problem

Given a sorted array **nums**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that duplicates appeared at most **twice** and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
  var len = nums.length;
  var index = 0;
  var last = NaN;
  var times = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === last) {
      if (times < 2) times++;
      else continue;
    } else {
      times = 1;
    }
    last = nums[i];
    nums[index] = nums[i];
    index++;
  }
  return index;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
