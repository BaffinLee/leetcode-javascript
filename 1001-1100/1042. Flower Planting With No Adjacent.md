## Problem

You have ```n``` gardens, labeled from ```1``` to ```n```, and an array ```paths``` where ```paths[i] = [xi, yi]``` describes a bidirectional path between garden ```xi``` to garden ```yi```. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return ****any** such a choice as an array **```answer```**, where **```answer[i]```** is the type of flower planted in the **```(i+1)th```** garden. The flower types are denoted **```1```**, **```2```**, **```3```**, or **```4```**. It is guaranteed an answer exists.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 104```
	
- ```0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104```
	
- ```paths[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= xi, yi <= n```
	
- ```xi != yi```
	
- Every garden has **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.
