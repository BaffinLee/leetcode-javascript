## Problem

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return **the **number of indices** where **`heights[i] != expected[i]`.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
	
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */
var heightChecker = function(heights) {
    var arr = Array.from(heights).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var count = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
        if (heights[i] !== arr[i]) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(nlog(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).
