## Problem

Given an array of positive integers ```arr``` (not necessarily distinct), return **the ****lexicographically**** largest permutation that is smaller than** ```arr```, that can be **made with exactly one swap**. If it cannot be done, then return the same array.

**Note** that a **swap** exchanges the positions of two numbers ```arr[i]``` and ```arr[j]```

 
Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,1,5]
Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: arr = [1,9,4,6,7]
Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= arr.length <= 104```
	
- ```1 <= arr[i] <= 104```



## Solution

```javascript

```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
