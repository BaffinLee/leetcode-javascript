## Problem

Say you have an array for which the **i**th element is the price of a given stock on day **i**.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most **two** transactions.

**Note: **You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  var buy1 = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
  var sell1 = 0;
  var buy2 = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
  var sell2 = 0;
  var len = prices.length;
  for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    buy1 = Math.max(buy1, -prices[i]);
    sell1 = Math.max(sell1, buy1 + prices[i]);
    buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - prices[i]);
    sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + prices[i]);
  }
  return sell2;
};
```

**Explain:**

重点就是让 `-buy1 + sell1 - buy2 + sell2` 最大。

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
