## Problem

Given a 2D board containing ```'X'``` and ```'O'``` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by ```'X'```.

A region is captured by flipping all ```'O'```s into ```'X'```s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any ```'O'``` on the border of the board are not flipped to ```'X'```. Any ```'O'``` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an ```'O'``` on the border will be flipped to ```'X'```. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.


## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
 */
var solve = function(board) {
  var xLen = board.length;
  var yLen = (board[0] || []).length;
  for (var i = 0; i < xLen; i++) {
    dfs(board, i, 0, xLen, yLen);
    dfs(board, i, yLen - 1, xLen, yLen);
  }
  for (var j = 0; j < yLen; j++) {
    dfs(board, 0, j, xLen, yLen);
    dfs(board, xLen - 1, j, xLen, yLen);
  }
  for (var m = 0; m < xLen; m++) {
    for (var n = 0; n < yLen; n++) {
      if (board[m][n] === '-') board[m][n] = 'O';
      else if (board[m][n] === 'O') board[m][n] = 'X';
    }
  }
};

var dfs = function (board, x, y, xLen, yLen) {
  if (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < xLen && y < yLen && board[x][y] === 'O') {
    board[x][y] = '-';
    dfs(board, x + 1, y, xLen, yLen);
    dfs(board, x - 1, y, xLen, yLen);
    dfs(board, x, y + 1, xLen, yLen);
    dfs(board, x, y - 1, xLen, yLen);
  }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(m * n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
