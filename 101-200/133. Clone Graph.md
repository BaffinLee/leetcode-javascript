## Problem

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a ```label``` and a list of its ```neighbors```.

**OJ's undirected graph serialization:**

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use ```#``` as a separator for each node, and ```,``` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph ```{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}```.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by ```#```.

- First node is labeled as ```0```. Connect node ```0``` to both nodes ```1``` and ```2```.
- Second node is labeled as ```1```. Connect node ```1``` to node ```2```.
- Third node is labeled as ```2```. Connect node ```2``` to node ```2``` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:
```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * function UndirectedGraphNode(label) {
 *     this.label = label;
 *     this.neighbors = [];   // Array of UndirectedGraphNode
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {UndirectedGraphNode} graph
 * @return {UndirectedGraphNode}
 */
var cloneGraph = function(graph) {
  return clone(graph, {});
};

var clone = function (node, map) {
  if (!node) return null;
  if (map[node.label]) return map[node.label];
  
  var cloneNode = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
  
  map[node.label] = cloneNode;
  
  for (var i = 0; i < node.neighbors.length; i++) {
    cloneNode.neighbors.push(clone(node.neighbors[i], map));
  }
  
  return cloneNode;
};
```

**Explain:**

不用管描述里的 `#` `,` 什么的，题意就是复制一个无向图，不要想复杂了。

注意有重复节点的话，存个引用就行，用哈希表判断是否重复。

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
