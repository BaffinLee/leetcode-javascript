## Problem

There are **N** children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} ratings
 * @return {number}
 */
var candy = function(ratings) {
  var len = ratings.length;
  var res = [];
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    res.push((i !== 0 && ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) ? (res[i - 1] + 1) : 1);
  }
  for (var j = len - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
    if (j !== len - 1 && ratings[j] > ratings[j + 1]) res[j] = Math.max(res[j], res[j + 1] + 1);
    sum += res[j];
  }
  return sum;
};
```

**Explain:**

分两次循环：第一次从左到右，上升的依次加 `1`，下降或者相等的填 `1`； 第二次从右到左，上升的依次加 `1`，下降或者相等的不管。

注意最高点可能之前填充过，需要取 `max` 值，才能同时满足两边的需求

第二次处理完后计算总和，省得另开一个循环

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
