## Problem

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example:  **

```
Input: "the sky is blue",
Output: "blue is sky the".
```

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Follow up: **For C programmers, try to solve it **in-place** in **O**(1) space.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} str
 * @returns {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function(str) {
  return str.split(' ').filter(s => s !== '').reverse().join(' ');
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
