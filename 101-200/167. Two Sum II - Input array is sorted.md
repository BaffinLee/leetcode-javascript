## Problem

Given an array of integers that is already ****sorted in ascending order****, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution and you may not use the **same** element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## Solution 1

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
  var sum = 0;
  var left = 0;
  var right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1];
    } else if (sum > target) {
      right--;
    } else {
      left++;
    }
  }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
