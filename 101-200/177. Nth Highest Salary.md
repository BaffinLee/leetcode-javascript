## Problem

Write a SQL query to get the **n**th highest salary from the ```Employee``` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the **n**th highest salary where **n** = 2 is ```200```. If there is no **n**th highest salary, then the query should return ```null```.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

## Solution

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT M, 1
  );
END
```
