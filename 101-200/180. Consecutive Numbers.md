## Problem

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```

For example, given the above ```Logs``` table, ```1``` is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

## Solution 1

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct A.Num as ConsecutiveNums
  from Logs A
  left join logs B
    on A.Id = B.Id - 1
  left join logs C
    on B.Id = C.Id - 1
  where A.Num = B.Num
    and B.Num = C.Num
```

**Explain:**

nope.
