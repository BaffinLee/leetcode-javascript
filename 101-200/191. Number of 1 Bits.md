## Problem

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Note:**


	
- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
	
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.


 
Example 1:

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.


 
**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    var count = 0;
    while (n) {
        if (n & 1) count++;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return count;
};
```

**Explain:**

use `>>>` instead of `>>`.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(1).
* Space complexity : O(1).
