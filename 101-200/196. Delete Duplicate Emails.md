## Problem

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

 

Write a solution to** delete** all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify `Person` in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter**.

The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```


## Solution

```javascript
# Write your MySQL query statement below
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2 WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
