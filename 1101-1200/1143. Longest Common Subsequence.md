## Problem

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return **the length of their longest **common subsequence**. **If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.


	
- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.


A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
	
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} text1
 * @param {string} text2
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestCommonSubsequence = function(text1, text2) {
    var dp = Array(text1.length).fill(0).map(() => Array(text2.length));
    var dfs = function(i, j) {
        if (i === text1.length || j === text2.length) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] !== undefined) return dp[i][j];
        if (text1[i] === text2[j]) {
            dp[i][j] = 1 + dfs(i + 1, j + 1);
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(
                dfs(i + 1, j),
                dfs(i, j + 1),
                dfs(i + 1, j + 1),
            );
        }
        return dp[i][j];
    };
    dfs(0, 0, 0);
    return dp[0][0];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * m).
* Space complexity : O(n * m).
