## Problem

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is **good** if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return **the sum of lengths of all good strings in words**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
	
- `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
	
- `words[i]` and `chars` consist of lowercase English letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var countCharacters = function(words, chars) {
    var map = Array(26).fill(0);
    var a = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
    for (var i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
        map[chars.charCodeAt(i) - a]++;
    }
    var res = 0;
    outerLoop: for (var m = 0; m < words.length; m++) {
        var arr = Array.from(map);
        for (var n = 0; n < words[m].length; n++) {
            if (--arr[words[m].charCodeAt(n) - a] < 0) continue outerLoop;
        }
        res += words[m].length;
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(m * n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
