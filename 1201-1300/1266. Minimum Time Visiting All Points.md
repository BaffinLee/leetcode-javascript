## Problem

On a 2D plane, there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return **the **minimum time** in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by **`points`.

You can move according to these rules:


	In `1` second, you can either:

	
		
- move vertically by one unit,
		
- move horizontally by one unit, or
		
- move diagonally `sqrt(2)` units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in `1` second).
	
	
	
- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
	
- You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.


 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/14/1626_example_1.PNG)

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
```

Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `points.length == n`
	
- `1 <= n <= 100`
	
- `points[i].length == 2`
	
- `-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var minTimeToVisitAllPoints = function(points) {
    return points.reduce((sum, point, index) => {
        if (index === 0) return 0;
        var diffX = Math.abs(point[0] - points[index - 1][0]);
        var diffY = Math.abs(point[1] - points[index - 1][1]);
        var second = Math.max(diffX, diffY);
        return sum + second;
    }, 0);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
