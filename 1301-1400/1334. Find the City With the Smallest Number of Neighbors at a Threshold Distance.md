## Problem

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `fromi` and `toi`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities ****i**** and ****j**** is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_01.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_02.png)

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= n <= 100`
	
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
	
- `edges[i].length == 3`
	
- `0 <= fromi < toi < n`
	
- `1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`
	
- All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @param {number} distanceThreshold
 * @return {number}
 */
var findTheCity = function(n, edges, distanceThreshold) {
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        map[edges[i][0]] = map[edges[i][0]] || {};
        map[edges[i][1]] = map[edges[i][1]] || {};
        map[edges[i][1]][edges[i][0]] = edges[i][2];
        map[edges[i][0]][edges[i][1]] = edges[i][2];
    }
    var min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    var minNum = -1;
    for (var j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        var cities = dijkstra(j, map, distanceThreshold);
        if (cities <= min) {
            min = cities;
            minNum = j;
        }
    }
    return minNum;
};

var dijkstra = function(n, map, distanceThreshold) {
    var visited = {};
    var queue = new MinPriorityQueue();
    queue.enqueue(n, 0);
    while (queue.size() > 0) {
        var { element, priority } = queue.dequeue();
        if (priority > distanceThreshold) break;
        if (visited[element]) continue;
        visited[element] = true;
        var arr = Object.keys(map[element] || {});
        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (visited[arr[i]]) continue;
            queue.enqueue(arr[i], priority + map[element][arr[i]]);
        }
    }
    return Object.keys(visited).length;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n ^ 3 * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n ^ 2).
