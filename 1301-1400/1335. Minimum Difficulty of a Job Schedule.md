## Problem

You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `ith` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `ith` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return **the minimum difficulty of a job schedule**. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return `-1`.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/untitled.png)

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
```

Example 2:

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
	
- `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
	
- `1 <= d <= 10`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} jobDifficulty
 * @param {number} d
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDifficulty = function(jobDifficulty, d) {
    var dp = Array(jobDifficulty.length).fill(0).map(() => Array(d));
    return helper(jobDifficulty, d, 0, dp);
};

var helper = function(jobs, d, index, dp) {
    if (jobs.length < d) return -1;
    if (d === 0 && index === jobs.length) return 0;
    if (d === 0) return Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    if (dp[index][d] !== undefined) return dp[index][d];
    var min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    var maxDifficulty = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
    for (var i = index; i <= jobs.length - d; i++) {
        maxDifficulty = Math.max(maxDifficulty, jobs[i]);
        min = Math.min(min, maxDifficulty + helper(jobs, d - 1, i + 1, dp));
    }
    dp[index][d] = min;
    return min;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * m).
* Space complexity : O(n * m).
