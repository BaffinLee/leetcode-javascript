## Problem

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of ```'L'``` and ```'R'``` characters.

Given a **balanced** string ```s```, split it into some number of substrings such that:


	
- Each substring is balanced.


Return **the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= s.length <= 1000```
	
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'L'``` or ```'R'```.
	
- ```s``` is a **balanced** string.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var balancedStringSplit = function(s) {
    var num = 0;
    var S = 0;
    var L = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === 'L') {
            L++;
        } else {
            S++;
        }
        if (S === L) {
            num++;
            S = 0;
            L = 0;
        }
    }
    return num;
};
```

**Explain:**

Every time you meet a balanced string, split it.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
