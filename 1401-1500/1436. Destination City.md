## Problem

You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityAi` to `cityBi`. **Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.**

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are: 
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"C" -> "A". 
"A". 
Clearly the destination city is "A".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
Output: "Z"
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= paths.length <= 100`
	
- `paths[i].length == 2`
	
- `1 <= cityAi.length, cityBi.length <= 10`
	
- `cityAi != cityBi`
	
- All strings consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} paths
 * @return {string}
 */
var destCity = function(paths) {
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {
        map[paths[i][0]] = map[paths[i][0]] || 0;
        map[paths[i][1]] = map[paths[i][1]] || 0;
        map[paths[i][0]] += 1;
    }
    var cities = Object.keys(map);
    for (var j = 0; j < cities.length; j++) {
        if (map[cities[j]] === 0) return cities[j];
    }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
