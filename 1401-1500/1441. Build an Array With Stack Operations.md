# 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations

## Problem

You are given an integer array `target` and an integer `n`.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:


	
- **`"Push"`**: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
	
- **`"Pop"`**: removes the integer on the top of the stack.


You also have a stream of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to `target`. You should follow the following rules:


	
- If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
	
- If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
	
- If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to `target`, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.


Return **the stack operations needed to build **`target` following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return **any of them**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2,3].
```

Example 3:

```
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop the stack operations.
The answers that read integer 3 from the stream are not accepted.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= target.length <= 100`
	
- `1 <= n <= 100`
	
- `1 <= target[i] <= n`
	
- `target` is strictly increasing.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} target
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var buildArray = function(target, n) {
    var res = [];
    var j = 1;
    for (var i = 0; i < target.length; i++) {
        while (j < target[i]) {
            res.push('Push');
            res.push('Pop');
            j++;
        }
        res.push('Push');
        j++;
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
