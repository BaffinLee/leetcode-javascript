## Problem

Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `true` **if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited**. Return `false` otherwise.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123929-pm.png)

```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)

```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= path.length <= 104`
	
- `path[i]` is either `'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'`, or `'W'`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} path
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPathCrossing = function(path) {
    var num = 0;
    var map = {
        N: 1,
        S: -1,
        E: 10000,
        W: -10000,
    };
    var visited = { '0': true };
    for (var i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {
        num += map[path[i]];
        if (visited[num]) return true;
        visited[num] = true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
