# 1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence

- Difficulty: Easy.

## Problem

A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` **if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return** `false`.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
	
- `-106 <= arr[i] <= 106`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canMakeArithmeticProgression = function(arr) {
    if (arr.length <= 2) return true;
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const differ = arr[1] - arr[0];
    return arr.every((item, i) => i === 0 || item - arr[i - 1] === differ);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(nlogn).
* Space complexity : O(1).
