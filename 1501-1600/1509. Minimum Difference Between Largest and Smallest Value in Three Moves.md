## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to **any value**.

Return **the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` **after performing at most three moves****.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,100,20]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
	
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDifference = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length <= 4) return 0;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return Math.min(
        nums[nums.length - 4] - nums[0],
        nums[nums.length - 3] - nums[1],
        nums[nums.length - 2] - nums[2],
        nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[3],
    );
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).

## Solution 2

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDifference = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length <= 4) return 0;
    var minQueue = new MinPriorityQueue();
    var maxQueue = new MaxPriorityQueue();
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        minQueue.enqueue(nums[i], nums[i]);
        if (minQueue.size() > 4) {
            minQueue.dequeue();
        }
        maxQueue.enqueue(nums[i], nums[i]);
        if (maxQueue.size() > 4) {
            maxQueue.dequeue();
        }
    }
    const arr = [
        ...maxQueue.toArray().map(item => item.element).reverse(),
        ...minQueue.toArray().map(item => item.element),
    ];
    return Math.min(
        arr[arr.length - 4] - arr[0],
        arr[arr.length - 3] - arr[1],
        arr[arr.length - 2] - arr[2],
        arr[arr.length - 1] - arr[3],
    );
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(4) * log(4)) = O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
