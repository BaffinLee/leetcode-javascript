## Problem

Given an integer array `arr` of **distinct** integers and an integer `k`.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`, the larger integer wins and remains at position `0`, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.

Return **the integer which will win the game**.

It is **guaranteed** that there will be a winner of the game.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= arr.length <= 105`
	
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 106`
	
- `arr` contains **distinct** integers.
	
- `1 <= k <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var getWinner = function(arr, k) {
    var maxIndex = 0;
    for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[maxIndex]) maxIndex = i;
        if (i - maxIndex + (maxIndex === 0 ? 0 : 1) === k) break;
    }
    return arr[maxIndex];
};
```

**Explain:**

We keep track of the maximum number index while iterating the array, in index i, the maximum number wined `i - maxIndex + 1` times (or `i - maxIndex` times if `maxIndex` is zero)


**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
