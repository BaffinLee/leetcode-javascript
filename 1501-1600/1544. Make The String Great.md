## Problem

Given a string `s` of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have **two adjacent characters** `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` where:


	
- `0 <= i <= s.length - 2`
	
- `s[i]` is a lower-case letter and `s[i + 1]` is the same letter but in upper-case or **vice-versa**.


To make the string good, you can choose **two adjacent** characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return **the string** after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

**Notice** that an empty string is also good.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "leEeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abBAcC"
Output: ""
Explanation: We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "s"
Output: "s"
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
	
- `s` contains only lower and upper case English letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var makeGood = function(s) {
    var i = 0;
    var res = [];
    while (i < s.length) {
        if (res.length
            && s[i] !== res[res.length - 1]
            && s[i].toLowerCase() === res[res.length - 1].toLowerCase()
        ) {
            res.pop();
        } else {
            res.push(s[i]);
        }
        i += 1;
    }
    return res.join('');
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
