## Problem

Given a** directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Find **the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable**. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

 
Example 1:


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled22.png)


```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
```

Example 2:


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled.png)


```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
	
- `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
	
- `edges[i].length == 2`
	
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
	
- All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.


## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findSmallestSetOfVertices = function(n, edges) {
    var map = Array(n).fill(0);
    for (var i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        map[edges[i][1]]++;
    }
    var res = [];
    for (var j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (map[j] === 0) {
            res.push(j);
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

Because it's guaranteed that a unique solution exists, so we can simply collect nodes with no incoming edge.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
