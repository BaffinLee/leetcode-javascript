## Problem

There are `3n` piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:


	
- In each step, you will choose **any **`3` piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
	
- Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
	
- You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
	
- Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
	
- Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.


Given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the `ith` pile.

Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: piles = [2,4,5]
Output: 4
```

Example 3:

```
Input: piles = [9,8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 18
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `3 <= piles.length <= 105`
	
- `piles.length % 3 == 0`
	
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} piles
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxCoins = function(piles) {
    piles.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var res = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < piles.length / 3; i++) {
        res += piles[piles.length - (i * 2) - 1 - 1];
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(1).
