## Problem

We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.

**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return **the maximum number of achievable requests**.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg)

```
Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 3
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests. 
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: 4
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 20`
	
- `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
	
- `requests[i].length == 2`
	
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} requests
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumRequests = function(n, requests) {
    return solve(n,  requests, Array(n).fill(0), 0, 0);
};

var solve = function(n, requests, indegree, index, count) {
    // end
    if (index === requests.length) {
        return indegree.every(i => i === 0) ? count : 0;
    }
    // take this request
    indegree[requests[index][0]]--;
    indegree[requests[index][1]]++;
    const res = solve(n, requests, indegree, index + 1, count + 1);
    indegree[requests[index][0]]++;
    indegree[requests[index][1]]--;
    // ignore this request
    return Math.max(
        res,
        solve(n, requests, indegree, index + 1, count),
    );
};
```

**Explain:**

For every request, we can take it or ignore it, use backtrack to track the count of people moved in a department, find out which way end up with maximum result.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
