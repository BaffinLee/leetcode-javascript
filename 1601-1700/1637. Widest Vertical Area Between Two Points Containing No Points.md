## Problem

Given `n` `points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return** the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area.**

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png)
​
```
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == points.length`
	
- `2 <= n <= 105`
	
- `points[i].length == 2`
	
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxWidthOfVerticalArea = function(points) {
    var maxGap = 0;
    points.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    for (var i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
    }
    return maxGap;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
