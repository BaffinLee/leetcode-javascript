## Problem

You are given an integer `n`, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:


	
- If the current number of teams is **even**, each team gets paired with another team. A total of `n / 2` matches are played, and `n / 2` teams advance to the next round.
	
- If the current number of teams is **odd**, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance to the next round.


Return **the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: Details of the tournament: 
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 14
Output: 13
Explanation: Details of the tournament:
- 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 200`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfMatches = function(n) {
    if (n === 1) return 0;
    if (n % 2) {
        return Math.floor(n / 2) + numberOfMatches((n + 1) / 2);
    } else {
        return (n / 2) + numberOfMatches(n / 2);
    }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(1).
