## Problem

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the **previous Monday**. 

Given `n`, return **the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the **`nth`** day.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 1000`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalMoney = function(n) {
    var weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);
    var lastWeekDays = n % 7;
    var sumOfWeeks = (4 + 4 + weeks - 1) * 7 * weeks / 2;
    var sumOfLastDays = Array(lastWeekDays).fill(0).reduce((sum, _, i) => {
        return sum + (i + 1) + weeks;
    }, 0);
    return sumOfWeeks + sumOfLastDays;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(1).
* Space complexity : O(1).
