## Problem

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude** between points `i`​​​​​​ and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n)`. Return **the **highest altitude** of a point.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == gain.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 100`
	
- `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} gain
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestAltitude = function(gain) {
    var max = 0;
    var cur = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < gain.length; i++) {
        cur += gain[i];
        max = Math.max(max, cur);
    }
    return max;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
