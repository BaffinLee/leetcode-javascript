## Problem

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:


	
- Pick a **non-empty** prefix from the string `s` where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
	
- Pick a **non-empty** suffix from the string `s` where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
	
- The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
	
- The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
	
- Delete both the prefix and the suffix.


Return **the **minimum length** of **`s` **after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times)**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ca"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can't remove any characters, so the string stays as is.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "cabaabac"
Output: 0
Explanation: An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "c" and suffix = "c" and remove them, s = "abaaba".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "baab".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "b" and remove them, s = "aa".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "aabccabba"
Output: 3
Explanation: An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "aa" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "bccabb".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "bb" and remove them, s = "cca".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
	
- `s` only consists of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumLength = function(s) {
    var left = 0;
    var right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right && s[left] === s[right]) {
        while (s[left] === s[left + 1] && left + 1 < right) left++;
        while (s[right] === s[right - 1] && right - 1 > left) right--;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return right - left + 1;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(0).
