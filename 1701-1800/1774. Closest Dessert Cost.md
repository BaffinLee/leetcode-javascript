## Problem

You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have `n` ice cream base flavors and `m` types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:


	
- There must be **exactly one** ice cream base.
	
- You can add **one or more** types of topping or have no toppings at all.
	
- There are **at most two** of **each type** of topping.


You are given three inputs:


	
- `baseCosts`, an integer array of length `n`, where each `baseCosts[i]` represents the price of the `ith` ice cream base flavor.
	
- `toppingCosts`, an integer array of length `m`, where each `toppingCosts[i]` is the price of **one** of the `ith` topping.
	
- `target`, an integer representing your target price for dessert.


You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to `target` as possible.

Return **the closest possible cost of the dessert to **`target`. If there are multiple, return **the **lower** one.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 7
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: baseCosts = [2,3], toppingCosts = [4,5,100], target = 18
Output: 17
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 3
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 4 = 4
- Take 2 of topping 1: cost 2 x 5 = 10
- Take 0 of topping 2: cost 0 x 100 = 0
Total: 3 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 17. You cannot make a dessert with a total cost of 18.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: baseCosts = [3,10], toppingCosts = [2,5], target = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: It is possible to make desserts with cost 8 and 10. Return 8 as it is the lower cost.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == baseCosts.length`
	
- `m == toppingCosts.length`
	
- `1 <= n, m <= 10`
	
- `1 <= baseCosts[i], toppingCosts[i] <= 104`
	
- `1 <= target <= 104`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} baseCosts
 * @param {number[]} toppingCosts
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var closestCost = function(baseCosts, toppingCosts, target) {
    var res = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    for (var i = 0; i < baseCosts.length; i++) {
        res = closest(target, res, baseCosts[i] + helper(toppingCosts, target - baseCosts[i], 0));
    }
    return res;
};

var helper = function(toppingCosts, target, i) {
    if (i === toppingCosts.length) return 0;
    if (target <= 0) return 0;
    var res = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    res = closest(target, res, helper(toppingCosts, target, i + 1));
    res = closest(target, res, toppingCosts[i] + helper(toppingCosts, target - toppingCosts[i], i + 1));
    res = closest(target, res, toppingCosts[i] * 2 + helper(toppingCosts, target - toppingCosts[i] * 2, i + 1));
    return res;
};

var closest = function(target, num1, num2) {
    var diff1 = Math.abs(num1 - target);
    var diff2 = Math.abs(num2 - target);
    if (diff1 === diff2) return Math.min(num1, num2);
    return diff1 < diff2 ? num1 : num2;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * m ^ 3).
* Space complexity : O(m).
