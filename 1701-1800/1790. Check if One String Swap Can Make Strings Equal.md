## Problem

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` **if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most one string swap **on **exactly one** of the strings. **Otherwise, return `false`.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
	
- `s1.length == s2.length`
	
- `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s1
 * @param {string} s2
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var areAlmostEqual = function(s1, s2) {
    var diffs = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        if (s1[i] !== s2[i]) diffs.push(i);
    }
    return diffs.length === 0 || (
        diffs.length === 2 &&
            s1[diffs[0]] === s2[diffs[1]] &&
            s1[diffs[1]] === s2[diffs[0]]
    );
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
