## Problem

There is a **3 lane road** of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` **points** labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog **starts** at point `0` in the **second **lane** **and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (**ranging from 0 to 3**) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be **at most one** obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.


	
- For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.


The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a **side jump** to jump to **another** lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the **same** point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.


	
- For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.


Return** the **minimum number of side jumps** the frog needs to reach **any lane** at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0.**

**Note:** There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q3-ex1.png)

```
Input: obstacles = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).
Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q3-ex2.png)

```
Input: obstacles = [0,1,1,3,3,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/ic234-q3-ex3.png)

```
Input: obstacles = [0,2,1,0,3,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `obstacles.length == n + 1`
	
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 105`
	
- `0 <= obstacles[i] <= 3`
	
- `obstacles[0] == obstacles[n] == 0`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} obstacles
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSideJumps = function(obstacles) {
    return helper(obstacles, 0, 2);
};

var helper = function(obstacles, i, lane) {
    if (i === obstacles.length) return 0;
    if (obstacles[i + 1] !== lane) return helper(obstacles, i + 1, lane);
    var nextIndex = -1;
    for (var j = i; j < obstacles.length; j++) {
        if (obstacles[j] !== lane && obstacles[j] !== 0) {
            nextIndex = j;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (nextIndex === -1) return 1;
    return 1 + helper(obstacles, nextIndex, 6 - lane - obstacles[nextIndex]);
};
```

**Explain:**

Greedy.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
