## Problem

You are given `n`​​​​​​ tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process **at most one** task at a time and will act in the following way:


	
- If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
	
- If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
	
- Once a task is started, the CPU will **process the entire task** without stopping.
	
- The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.


Return **the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
Output: [0,2,3,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]]
Output: [4,3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows:
- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.
- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.
- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.
- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `tasks.length == n`
	
- `1 <= n <= 105`
	
- `1 <= enqueueTimei, processingTimei <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} tasks
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var getOrder = function(tasks) {
    var arr = tasks.map((task, i) => [task[0], task[1], i]).sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    var queue = new MinPriorityQueue();
    var i = 0;
    var res = [];
    var lastTime = 0;
    while (i < arr.length || queue.size()) {
        if (!queue.size() && arr[i][0] > lastTime) {
            lastTime = arr[i][0];
        }

        while (arr[i] && arr[i][0] <= lastTime) {
            var priority = arr[i][1] + (arr[i][2] / Math.pow(10, `${arr.length}`.length));
            queue.enqueue(arr[i], priority);
            i++;
        }

        var task = queue.dequeue().element;
        res.push(task[2]);
        lastTime += task[1];
    }

    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
