## Problem

Design a system that manages the reservation state of `n` seats that are numbered from `1` to `n`.

Implement the `SeatManager` class:


	
- `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`. All seats are initially available.
	
- `int reserve()` Fetches the **smallest-numbered** unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
	
- `void unreserve(int seatNumber)` Unreserves the seat with the given `seatNumber`.


Â 
Example 1:

```
Input
["SeatManager", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve"]
[[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]

Explanation
SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.
seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.
seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.
seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].
```

Â 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 105`
	
- `1 <= seatNumber <= n`
	
- For each call to `reserve`, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.
	
- For each call to `unreserve`, it is guaranteed that `seatNumber` will be reserved.
	
- At most `105` calls **in total** will be made to `reserve` and `unreserve`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 */
var SeatManager = function(n) {
    this.queue = new MinPriorityQueue();
    this.index = 1;
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
SeatManager.prototype.reserve = function() {
    if (this.queue.size()) {
        return this.queue.dequeue().element;
    }
    return this.index++;
};

/** 
 * @param {number} seatNumber
 * @return {void}
 */
SeatManager.prototype.unreserve = function(seatNumber) {
    if (seatNumber === this.index - 1) {
        this.index--;
        return;
    }
    this.queue.enqueue(seatNumber, seatNumber);
};

/** 
 * Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new SeatManager(n)
 * var param_1 = obj.reserve()
 * obj.unreserve(seatNumber)
 */
```

**Explain:**

The `index` is the start of unreserved seats number.

The `queue` is a min priority queue about unreserved seats before `index`

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(m * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).
