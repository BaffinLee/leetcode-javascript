## Problem

You are given an array of strings `words` (**0-indexed**).

In one operation, pick two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, where `words[i]` is a non-empty string, and move **any** character from `words[i]` to **any** position in `words[j]`.

Return `true` **if you can make** every** string in **`words`** **equal **using **any** number of operations**,** and **`false` **otherwise**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
	
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
	
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var makeEqual = function(words) {
    var map = Array(26).fill(0);
    var a = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
    for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        for (var j = 0; j < words[i].length; j++) {
            map[words[i][j].charCodeAt(0) - a]++;
        }
    }
    return map.every(item => item % words.length === 0);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * m).
* Space complexity : O(1).
