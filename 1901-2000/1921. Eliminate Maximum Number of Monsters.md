## Problem

You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of `n` monsters. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `dist` of size `n`, where `dist[i]` is the **initial distance** in kilometers of the `ith` monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a **constant** speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array `speed` of size `n`, where `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` monster in kilometers per minute.

You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a **single** monster. However, the weapon takes **one minute** to charge. The weapon is fully charged at the very start.

You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a **loss**, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.

Return **the **maximum** number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or **`n`** if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the thrid monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == dist.length == speed.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 105`
	
- `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 105`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} dist
 * @param {number[]} speed
 * @return {number}
 */
var eliminateMaximum = function(dist, speed) {
    var times = dist.map((d, i) => d / speed[i]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    for (var i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
        if (times[i] <= i) return i;
    }
    return dist.length;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).
