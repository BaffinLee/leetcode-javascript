## Problem

Given a string `s`, return **the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of **`s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.


	
- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.


 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `3 <= s.length <= 105`
	
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPalindromicSubsequence = function(s) {
    var a = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
    var res = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        var char = String.fromCharCode(i + a);
        var first = s.indexOf(char);
        var last = s.lastIndexOf(char);
        if (last - first < 2) continue;
        var map = {};
        for (var j = first + 1; j < last; j++) {
            if (!map[s[j]]) {
                res += 1;
                map[s[j]] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
