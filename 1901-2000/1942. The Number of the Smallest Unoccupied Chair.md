## Problem

There is a party where `n` friends numbered from `0` to `n - 1` are attending. There is an **infinite** number of chairs in this party that are numbered from `0` to `infinity`. When a friend arrives at the party, they sit on the unoccupied chair with the **smallest number**.


	
- For example, if chairs `0`, `1`, and `5` are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number `2`.


When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `times` where `times[i] = [arrivali, leavingi]`, indicating the arrival and leaving times of the `ith` friend respectively, and an integer `targetFriend`. All arrival times are **distinct**.

Return** the **chair number** that the friend numbered **`targetFriend`** will sit on**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: times = [[1,4],[2,3],[4,6]], targetFriend = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Friend 0 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.
- Friend 1 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.
- Friend 1 leaves at time 3 and chair 1 becomes empty.
- Friend 0 leaves at time 4 and chair 0 becomes empty.
- Friend 2 arrives at time 4 and sits on chair 0.
Since friend 1 sat on chair 1, we return 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: times = [[3,10],[1,5],[2,6]], targetFriend = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Friend 1 arrives at time 1 and sits on chair 0.
- Friend 2 arrives at time 2 and sits on chair 1.
- Friend 0 arrives at time 3 and sits on chair 2.
- Friend 1 leaves at time 5 and chair 0 becomes empty.
- Friend 2 leaves at time 6 and chair 1 becomes empty.
- Friend 0 leaves at time 10 and chair 2 becomes empty.
Since friend 0 sat on chair 2, we return 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == times.length`
	
- `2 <= n <= 104`
	
- `times[i].length == 2`
	
- `1 <= arrivali < leavingi <= 105`
	
- `0 <= targetFriend <= n - 1`
	
- Each `arrivali` time is **distinct**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} times
 * @param {number} targetFriend
 * @return {number}
 */
var smallestChair = function(times, targetFriend) {
    var emptyChairs = new Set();
    var max = -1;
    var list = times.reduce((arr, item, i) => {
        arr.push({ i, type: 1, time: item[0] });
        arr.push({ i, type: 2, time: item[1] });
        return arr;
    }, []).sort((a, b) => {
        // be careful if someone's arrival time equals the other's leave time
        // make sure we process leave one first
        if (a.time === b.time) {
            return b.type - a.type;
        }
        return a.time - b.time;
    });
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        var item = list[i];
        if (item.type === 1) {
            // someone arrival
            if (emptyChairs.size) {
                // found empty chair someone left before
                map[item.i] = findMin(emptyChairs);
                emptyChairs.delete(map[item.i]);
            } else {
                // go to the last chair
                map[item.i] = max + 1;
                max = map[item.i];
            }
            if (item.i === targetFriend) {
                break;
            }
        } else {
            // someone leave
            emptyChairs.add(map[item.i]);
        }
    }
    return map[targetFriend];
};

// should replace set with min heap
// so that time complexity could be O(nlog(n))
var findMin = function(list) {
    return Array.from(list).sort((a, b) => a - b)[0];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n^2).
* Space complexity : O(n).
