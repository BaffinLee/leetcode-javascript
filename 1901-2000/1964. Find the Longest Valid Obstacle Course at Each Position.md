## Problem

You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `obstacles` of length `n`, where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of the `ith` obstacle.

For every index `i` between `0` and `n - 1` (**inclusive**), find the length of the **longest obstacle course** in `obstacles` such that:


	
- You choose any number of obstacles between `0` and `i` **inclusive**.
	
- You must include the `ith` obstacle in the course.
	
- You must put the chosen obstacles in the **same order** as they appear in `obstacles`.
	
- Every obstacle (except the first) is **taller** than or the **same height** as the obstacle immediately before it.


Return **an array** `ans` **of length** `n`, **where** `ans[i]` **is the length of the **longest obstacle course** for index** `i`** as described above**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: obstacles = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,2,3,3]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [1], [1] has length 1.
- i = 1: [1,2], [1,2] has length 2.
- i = 2: [1,2,3], [1,2,3] has length 3.
- i = 3: [1,2,3,2], [1,2,2] has length 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: obstacles = [2,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [2], [2] has length 1.
- i = 1: [2,2], [2,2] has length 2.
- i = 2: [2,2,1], [1] has length 1.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: obstacles = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
Output: [1,1,2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [3], [3] has length 1.
- i = 1: [3,1], [1] has length 1.
- i = 2: [3,1,5], [3,5] has length 2. [1,5] is also valid.
- i = 3: [3,1,5,6], [3,5,6] has length 3. [1,5,6] is also valid.
- i = 4: [3,1,5,6,4], [3,4] has length 2. [1,4] is also valid.
- i = 5: [3,1,5,6,4,2], [1,2] has length 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == obstacles.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 105`
	
- `1 <= obstacles[i] <= 107`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} obstacles
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition = function(obstacles) {
    var res = Array(obstacles.length).fill(1);
    var stack = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < obstacles.length; i++) {
        if (!stack.length || obstacles[i] >= stack[stack.length - 1]) {
            res[i] = (stack.length || 0) + 1;
            stack.push(obstacles[i]);
        } else {
            var index = binarySearch(stack, obstacles[i]);
            res[i] = index + 1;
            stack[index] = obstacles[i];
        }
    }
    return res;
};

var binarySearch = function(arr, num) {
    var left = 0;
    var right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        var mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] <= num) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    return left;
};

```
