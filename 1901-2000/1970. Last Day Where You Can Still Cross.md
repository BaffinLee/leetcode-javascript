## Problem

There is a **1-based** binary matrix where `0` represents land and `1` represents water. You are given integers `row` and `col` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

Initially on day `0`, the **entire** matrix is **land**. However, each day a new cell becomes flooded with **water**. You are given a **1-based** 2D array `cells`, where `cells[i] = [ri, ci]` represents that on the `ith` day, the cell on the `rith` row and `cith` column (**1-based** coordinates) will be covered with **water** (i.e., changed to `1`).

You want to find the **last** day that it is possible to walk from the **top** to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells. You can start from **any** cell in the top row and end at **any** cell in the bottom row. You can only travel in the** four** cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).

Return **the **last** day where it is possible to walk from the **top** to the **bottom** by only walking on land cells**.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/1.png)

```
Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 2.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/2.png)

```
Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 1.
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/3.png)

```
Input: row = 3, col = 3, cells = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[1,3],[2,3],[3,2],[3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The above image depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= row, col <= 2 * 104`
	
- `4 <= row * col <= 2 * 104`
	
- `cells.length == row * col`
	
- `1 <= ri <= row`
	
- `1 <= ci <= col`
	
- All the values of `cells` are **unique**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} row
 * @param {number} col
 * @param {number[][]} cells
 * @return {number}
 */
var latestDayToCross = function(row, col, cells) {
    var left = 0;
    var right = cells.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        var mid = left + Math.ceil((right - left) / 2);
        if (canCross(row, col, cells, mid)) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return left + 1;
};

var canCross = function(row, col, cells, day) {
    var grid = Array(row).fill(0).map(() => Array(col).fill(0));
    for (var i = 0; i <= day; i++) {
        grid[cells[i][0] - 1][cells[i][1] - 1] = 1;
    }
    var queue = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < col; i++) {
        if (grid[0][i] === 0) {
            queue.push([0, i]);
            grid[0][i] = 2;
        }
    }
    while (queue.length !== 0) {
        var [r, c] = queue.shift();
        if (r === row - 1) return true;
        if (grid[r - 1] && grid[r - 1][c] === 0) {
            queue.push([r - 1, c]);
            grid[r - 1][c] = 2;
        }
        if (grid[r + 1] && grid[r + 1][c] === 0) {
            queue.push([r + 1, c]);
            grid[r + 1][c] = 2;
        }
        if (grid[r][c - 1] === 0) {
            queue.push([r, c - 1]);
            grid[r][c - 1] = 2;
        }
        if (grid[r][c + 1] === 0) {
            queue.push([r, c + 1]);
            grid[r][c + 1] = 2;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

**Explain:**

1. check if nth day can walk through all the land from top to bottom, use BFS (Breadth first search), for each land, check top/bottom/left/right four direction can cross or not.
2. if nth day can cross, the last day should be in `n ~ last`, otherwise `0 ~ n - 1`, so that we can use binary search to find the answer.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(row * col * log(row * col)).
* Space complexity : O(row * col).
