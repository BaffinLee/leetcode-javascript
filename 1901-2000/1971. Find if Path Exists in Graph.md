## Problem

There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex `source` to vertex `destination`.

Given `edges` and the integers `n`, `source`, and `destination`, return `true`** if there is a **valid path** from **`source`** to **`destination`**, or **`false`** otherwise****.**

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: true
Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 105`
	
- `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105`
	
- `edges[i].length == 2`
	
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
	
- `ui != vi`
	
- `0 <= source, destination <= n - 1`
	
- There are no duplicate edges.
	
- There are no self edges.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @param {number} source
 * @param {number} destination
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var validPath = function(n, edges, source, destination) {
    var dp = Array(n);
    var map = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    for (var i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        map[edges[i][0]].push(edges[i][1]);
        map[edges[i][1]].push(edges[i][0]);
    }
    var dfs = function(i) {
        if (i === destination) return true;
        if (dp[i] !== undefined) return dp[i];
        dp[i] = false;
        for (var j = 0; j < map[i].length; j++) {
            if (dfs(map[i][j])) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        return dp[i];
    };
    return dfs(source);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
