## Problem

Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` **unique** binary strings each of length `n`, return **a binary string of length **`n`** that **does not appear** in **`nums`**. If there are multiple answers, you may return **any** of them**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
Output: "101"
Explanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == nums.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 16`
	
- `nums[i].length == n`
	
- `nums[i] `is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
	
- All the strings of `nums` are **unique**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} nums
 * @return {string}
 */
var findDifferentBinaryString = function(nums) {
    var str = '';
    for (var i = 0; i <= nums.length; i++) {
        str = i.toString(2);
        str = '0'.repeat(nums.length - str.length) + str;
        if (!nums.includes(str)) {
            return str;
        }
    }
};
```

**Explain:**

Since array `nums` only contains `n` numbers, if we got `n + 1` numbers, there mush have at lease one number not in that array.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
