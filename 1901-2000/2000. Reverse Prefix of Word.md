## Problem

Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.


	
- For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should **reverse** the segment that starts at `0` and ends at `3` (**inclusive**). The resulting string will be `"dcbaefd"`.


Return **the resulting string**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= word.length <= 250`
	
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
	
- `ch` is a lowercase English letter.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @param {character} ch
 * @return {string}
 */
var reversePrefix = function(word, ch) {
    var index = word.indexOf(ch);
    if (index === -1) return word;
    var arr = word.split('');
    for (var i = 0; i < index / 2; i++) {
        var tmp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[index - i];
        arr[index - i] = tmp;
    }
    return arr.join('');
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
