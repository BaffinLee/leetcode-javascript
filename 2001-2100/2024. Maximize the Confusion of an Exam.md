## Problem

A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting true and `'F'` denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by **maximizing** the number of **consecutive** questions with the **same** answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `ith` question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:


	
- Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).


Return **the **maximum** number of consecutive** `'T'`s or `'F'`s **in the answer key after performing the operation at most** `k` **times**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = "TTTT".
There are four consecutive 'T's.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "FFFT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "TFFF".
In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT"
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT". 
In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == answerKey.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
	
- `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` or `'F'`
	
- `1 <= k <= n`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} answerKey
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxConsecutiveAnswers = function(answerKey, k) {
    var max = 1;
    var numF = answerKey[0] === 'F' ? 1 : 0;
    var numT = answerKey[0] === 'T' ? 1 : 0;
    var left = 0;
    var right = 0;
    while (left <= right && right <= answerKey.length - 1) {
        if (Math.min(numF, numT) <= k) {
            max = Math.max(max, right - left + 1);
            right += 1;
            answerKey[right] === 'T' ? numT++ : numF++;
        } else {
            answerKey[left] === 'T' ? numT-- : numF--;
            left += 1;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
```

**Explain:**

Sliding window.

If we slice a sub string from the answer string, we could either change `T` to `F` or `F` to `T` to make this sub string consecutive.

Because we can only change `k` times, which means `min(num(T), num(F))` should less or equal than `k`.

If that sub string is valid, we could move `right` index forward and update the max length of consecutive sub string, otherwise we move `left` index forward.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
