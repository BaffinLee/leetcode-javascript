## Problem

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where `relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej]` denotes that course `prevCoursej` has to be completed **before** course `nextCoursej` (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a **0-indexed** integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many **months** it takes to complete the `(i+1)th` course.

You must find the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:


	
- You may start taking a course at **any time** if the prerequisites are met.
	
- **Any number of courses** can be taken at the **same time**.


Return **the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses**.

**Note:** The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/07/ex1.png)


```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]], time = [3,2,5]
Output: 8
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. 
We start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.
Course 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.
Thus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/07/ex2.png)


```
Input: n = 5, relations = [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[3,4],[4,5]], time = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 12
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.
You can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.
You can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.
Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.
Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.
Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
	
- `0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 5 * 104)`
	
- `relations[j].length == 2`
	
- `1 <= prevCoursej, nextCoursej <= n`
	
- `prevCoursej != nextCoursej`
	
- All the pairs `[prevCoursej, nextCoursej]` are **unique**.
	
- `time.length == n`
	
- `1 <= time[i] <= 104`
	
- The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} relations
 * @param {number[]} time
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumTime = function(n, relations, time) {
    var graph = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    for (var i = 0; i < relations.length; i++) {
        var [a, b] = relations[i];
        graph[a - 1].push(b - 1);
    }

    var max = 0;
    var dp = Array(n);
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        max = Math.max(max, dfs(i, graph, time, dp));
    }
    return max;
};

var dfs = function(i, graph, time, dp) {
    if (dp[i] !== undefined) return dp[i];
    var max = 0;
    for (var j = 0; j < graph[i].length; j++) {
        max = Math.max(max, dfs(graph[i][j], graph, time, dp));
    }
    dp[i] = max + time[i];
    return dp[i];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n + m).
* Space complexity : O(n + m).
