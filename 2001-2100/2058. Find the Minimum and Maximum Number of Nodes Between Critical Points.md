## Problem

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return **an array of length 2 containing **`[minDistance, maxDistance]`** where **`minDistance`** is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and **`maxDistance`** is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return **`[-1, -1]`.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a1.png)

```
Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png)

```
Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/14/a5.png)

```
Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[2, 105]`.
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var nodesBetweenCriticalPoints = function(head) {
    var firstPoint = -1;
    var lastPoint = -1;
    var last = null;
    var now = head;
    var i = 0;
    var minDistance = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    while (now) {
        if (last && now.next && ((now.val > last.val && now.val > now.next.val) || (now.val < last.val && now.val < now.next.val))) {
            if (firstPoint === -1) firstPoint = i;
            if (lastPoint !== -1) minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, i - lastPoint);
            lastPoint = i;
        }
        last = now;
        now = now.next;
        i += 1;
    }
    if (firstPoint !== -1 && lastPoint !== -1 && lastPoint !== firstPoint) {
        return [minDistance, lastPoint - firstPoint];
    }
    return [-1, -1];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**
