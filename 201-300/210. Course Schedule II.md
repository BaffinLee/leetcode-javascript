## Problem

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.


	
- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.


Return **the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses**. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

Example 3:

```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
	
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
	
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
	
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
	
- `ai != bi`
	
- All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} numCourses
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findOrder = function(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    var requiredByMap = Array(numCourses).fill(0).map(() => []);
    var requiringMap = Array(numCourses).fill(0);
    for (var i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++) {
        requiringMap[prerequisites[i][0]]++;
        requiredByMap[prerequisites[i][1]].push(prerequisites[i][0]);
    }
    var queue = [];
    for (var j = 0; j < numCourses; j++) {
        requiringMap[j] === 0 && queue.push(j);
    }
    var res = [];
    while (queue.length) {
        var course = queue.pop();
        res.push(course);
        for (var k = 0; k < requiredByMap[course].length; k++) {
            requiringMap[requiredByMap[course][k]]--;
            requiringMap[requiredByMap[course][k]] === 0 && queue.push(requiredByMap[course][k]);
        }
    }
    return res.length === numCourses ? res : [];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
