## Problem

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return **the only number in the range that is missing from the array.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == nums.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 104`
	
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
	
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.


 
**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?


## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var missingNumber = function(nums) {
    var sum = nums.reduce((s, i) => s + i, 0);
    return nums.length * (nums.length + 1) / 2 - sum;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
