## Problem

Given a string `s` consisting of **only** the characters `'a'` and `'b'`, return `true` **if **every** **`'a'` **appears before **every** **`'b'`** in the string**. Otherwise, return `false`.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aaabbb"
Output: true
Explanation:
The 'a's are at indices 0, 1, and 2, while the 'b's are at indices 3, 4, and 5.
Hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: false
Explanation:
There is an 'a' at index 2 and a 'b' at index 1.
Hence, not every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return false.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "bbb"
Output: true
Explanation:
There are no 'a's, hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
	
- `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkString = function(s) {
    var hasB = false;
    for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === 'a' && hasB) return false;
        hasB = s[i] === 'b';
    }
    return true;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
