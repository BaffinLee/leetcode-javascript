## Problem

In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.


	
- For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.


The **twin sum **is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return **the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list**.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg1drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg2drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg3drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 105]`.
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {number}
 */
var pairSum = function(head) {
    var num = 0;
    var node = head;
    while (node) {
        num++;
        node = node.next;
    }

    var stack = [];
    var sum = 0;
    var i = 0;
    while (i < num) {
        if (i < num / 2) {
            stack.push(head.val);
        } else {
            sum = Math.max(sum, head.val + stack.pop());
        }
        i += 1;
        head = head.next;
    }

    return sum;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
