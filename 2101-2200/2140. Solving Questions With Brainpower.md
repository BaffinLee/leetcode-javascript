## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you `pointsi` points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.


	For example, given `questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:

	
		
- If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
		
- If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.
	
	


Return **the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.
- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2
- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points
Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 1 and 4.
- Skip question 0
- Solve question 1: Earn 2 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 2 and 3
- Solve question 4: Earn 5 points
Total points earned: 2 + 5 = 7. There is no other way to earn 7 or more points.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= questions.length <= 105`
	
- `questions[i].length == 2`
	
- `1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 105`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} questions
 * @return {number}
 */
var mostPoints = function(questions) {
    var dp = Array(questions.length);
    for (var i = questions.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        var [points, brainpower] = questions[i];
        dp[i] = Math.max(
            points + (dp[i + brainpower + 1] || 0),
            dp[i + 1] || 0,
        );
    }
    return dp[0];
};
```

**Explain:**

Dynamic-programming.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
