## Problem

You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of integers **separated** by `0`'s. The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For **every **two consecutive `0`'s, **merge** all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the **sum** of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.

Return **the** `head` **of the modified linked list**.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/02/ex1-1.png)

```
Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/02/ex2-1.png)

```
Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
Output: [1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 105]`.
	
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
	
- There are **no** two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.
	
- The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var mergeNodes = function(head) {
    var newHead = new ListNode();
    var resNow = newHead;
    var now = head;
    while (now) {
        if (now.val === 0 && now.next) {
            resNow.next = new ListNode();
            resNow = resNow.next;
        } else if (now.val !== 0) {
            resNow.val += now.val;
        }
        now = now.next;
    }
    return newHead.next;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
