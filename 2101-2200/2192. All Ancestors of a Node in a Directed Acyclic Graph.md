## Problem

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**).

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` denotes that there is a **unidirectional** edge from `fromi` to `toi` in the graph.

Return **a list** `answer`**, where **`answer[i]`** is the **list of ancestors** of the** `ith` **node, sorted in **ascending order****.

A node `u` is an **ancestor** of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v` via a set of edges.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/12/e1.png)

```
Input: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
Output: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation:
The above diagram represents the input graph.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.
- Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
- Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.
- Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/12/e2.png)

```
Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Output: [[],[0],[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation:
The above diagram represents the input graph.
- Node 0 does not have any ancestor.
- Node 1 has one ancestor 0.
- Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
- Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
	
- `0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
	
- `edges[i].length == 2`
	
- `0 <= fromi, toi <= n - 1`
	
- `fromi != toi`
	
- There are no duplicate edges.
	
- The graph is **directed** and **acyclic**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var getAncestors = function(n, edges) {
    const parentMap = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    const ancestorMap = Array(n);
    for (var i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        parentMap[edges[i][1]].push(edges[i][0]);
    }
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        find(i, parentMap, ancestorMap);
    }
    return ancestorMap.map(item => item.sort((a, b) => a - b));
};

var find = function(i, parentMap, ancestorMap) {
    if (!ancestorMap[i]) {
        var res = [];
        var arr = parentMap[i];
        for (var j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            res.push(arr[j], ...find(arr[j], parentMap, ancestorMap));
        }
        ancestorMap[i] = Array.from(new Set(res));
    }
    return ancestorMap[i];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
