## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the **same difficulty level**.

Return **the **minimum** rounds required to complete all the tasks, or **`-1`** if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: tasks = [2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= tasks.length <= 105`
	
- `1 <= tasks[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} tasks
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumRounds = function(tasks) {
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
        if (!map[tasks[i]]) map[tasks[i]] = 0;
        map[tasks[i]]++;
    }
    var keys = Object.keys(map);
    var res = 0;
    for (var j = 0; j < keys.length; j++) {
        if (map[keys[j]] === 1) return -1;
        res += Math.ceil(map[keys[j]] / 3);
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
