## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `flowers`, where `flowers[i] = [starti, endi]` means the `ith` flower will be in **full bloom** from `starti` to `endi` (**inclusive**). You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `people` of size `n`, where `people[i]` is the time that the `ith` person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return **an integer array **`answer`** of size **`n`**, where **`answer[i]`** is the **number** of flowers that are in full bloom when the **`ith`** person arrives.**

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/ex1new.jpg)

```
Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], poeple = [2,3,7,11]
Output: [1,2,2,2]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/ex2new.jpg)

```
Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], poeple = [3,3,2]
Output: [2,2,1]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 104`
	
- `flowers[i].length == 2`
	
- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 109`
	
- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
	
- `1 <= people[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} flowers
 * @param {number[]} people
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var fullBloomFlowers = function(flowers, people) {
    var flowersSortByStart = flowers.map(flower => flower[0]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var flowersSortByEnd = flowers.map(flower => flower[1]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var peopleTimesSort = Array.from(people).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var map = {};
    var startIndex = 0;
    var endIndex = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < peopleTimesSort.length; i++) {
        var time = peopleTimesSort[i];
        // number of flowers started before or in time
        startIndex = findStartIndex(flowersSortByStart, time, startIndex);
        // number of flowers ended before time
        endIndex = findEndIndex(flowersSortByEnd, time, endIndex);
        // full bloom flower number = flower started number - flower ended number
        map[time] = startIndex - endIndex;
    }
    return people.map((time) => map[time]);
};

var findStartIndex = function(times, time, from) {
    for (var i = from; i <= times.length; i++) {
        if (times[i] <= time) continue;
        return i;
    }
};

var findEndIndex = function(times, time, from) {
    for (var i = from; i <= times.length; i++) {
        if (times[i] < time) continue;
        return i;
    }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(nlog(n) + mlog(m) + n + m).
* Space complexity : O(n + m).
