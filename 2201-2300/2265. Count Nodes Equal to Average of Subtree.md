## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return **the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the **average** of the values in its **subtree****.

**Note:**


	
- The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.
	
- A **subtree** of `root` is a tree consisting of `root` and all of its descendants.


 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/15/image-20220315203925-1.png)

```
Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/26/image-20220326133920-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
	
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var averageOfSubtree = function(root) {
    return helper(root).res;
};

var helper = function(root) {
    if (!root) return { sum: 0, num: 0, res: 0 };
    var left = helper(root.left);
    var right = helper(root.right);
    var sum = left.sum + right.sum + root.val;
    var num = left.num + right.num + 1;
    var res = left.res + right.res + (Math.floor(sum / num) === root.val ? 1 : 0);
    return { sum, num, res };
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
