## Problem

You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `ith` bag. You are also given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute **all** the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The **unfairness** of a distribution is defined as the **maximum** **total** cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return **the **minimum** unfairness of all distributions**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
- The 1st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]
- The 1st child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.
- The 3rd child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= cookies.length <= 8`
	
- `1 <= cookies[i] <= 105`
	
- `2 <= k <= cookies.length`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} cookies
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var distributeCookies = function(cookies, k) {
    var arr = Array(k).fill(0);
    return helper(cookies, k, 0, 0, arr);
};

var helper = function(cookies, k, i, n, map) {
    var min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    if (i === cookies.length && n === k) return Math.max(...map);
    if (cookies.length - i < k - n) return min;
    for (var j = 0; j < k; j++) {
        map[j] += cookies[i];
        min = Math.min(
            min,
            helper(cookies, k, i + 1, map[j] === cookies[i] ? n + 1 : n, map),
        );
        map[j] -= cookies[i];
    }
    return min;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n ^ k).
* Space complexity : O(k).
