## Problem

There is a street with `n * 2` **plots**, where there are `n` plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from `1` to `n`. On each plot, a house can be placed.

Return **the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street**. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Note that if a house is placed on the `ith` plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the `ith` plot on the other side of the street.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Possible arrangements:
1. All plots are empty.
2. A house is placed on one side of the street.
3. A house is placed on the other side of the street.
4. Two houses are placed, one on each side of the street.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: The 9 possible arrangements are shown in the diagram above.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 104`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var countHousePlacements = function(n) {
    var lastHasHouse = 0;
    var lastNoHouse = 1;
    var mod = Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;
    var tmp = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        tmp = (lastHasHouse + lastNoHouse) % mod;
        lastHasHouse = lastNoHouse;
        lastNoHouse = tmp;
    }
    tmp = (lastHasHouse + lastNoHouse) % mod;
    return Number((BigInt(tmp) * BigInt(tmp)) % BigInt(mod));
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
