## Problem

You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **exactly one** outgoing edge.

The graph is represented by a given **0-indexed** integer array `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a **directed** edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

The **edge score** of a node `i` is defined as the sum of the **labels** of all the nodes that have an edge pointing to `i`.

Return **the node with the highest **edge score****. If multiple nodes have the same **edge score**, return the node with the **smallest** index.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/20/image-20220620195403-1.png)

```
Input: edges = [1,0,0,0,0,7,7,5]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- The nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 have an edge pointing to node 0. The edge score of node 0 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
- The node 0 has an edge pointing to node 1. The edge score of node 1 is 0.
- The node 7 has an edge pointing to node 5. The edge score of node 5 is 7.
- The nodes 5 and 6 have an edge pointing to node 7. The edge score of node 7 is 5 + 6 = 11.
Node 7 has the highest edge score so return 7.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/20/image-20220620200212-3.png)

```
Input: edges = [2,0,0,2]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- The nodes 1 and 2 have an edge pointing to node 0. The edge score of node 0 is 1 + 2 = 3.
- The nodes 0 and 3 have an edge pointing to node 2. The edge score of node 2 is 0 + 3 = 3.
Nodes 0 and 2 both have an edge score of 3. Since node 0 has a smaller index, we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == edges.length`
	
- `2 <= n <= 105`
	
- `0 <= edges[i] < n`
	
- `edges[i] != i`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} edges
 * @return {number}
 */
var edgeScore = function(edges) {
    var sumMap = Array(edges.length).fill(0);
    var maxSumNode = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        sumMap[edges[i]] += i;
        if (sumMap[edges[i]] > sumMap[maxSumNode]
            || (sumMap[edges[i]] === sumMap[maxSumNode] && maxSumNode > edges[i])) {
            maxSumNode = edges[i];
        }
    }
    return maxSumNode;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
