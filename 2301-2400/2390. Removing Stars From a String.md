## Problem

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:


	
- Choose a star in `s`.
	
- Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.


Return **the string after **all** stars have been removed**.

**Note:**


	
- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
	
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.


 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
	
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
	
- The operation above can be performed on `s`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var removeStars = function(s) {
    var stack = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '*') {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(s[i]);
        }
    }
    return stack.join('');
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
