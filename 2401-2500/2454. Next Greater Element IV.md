## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array of non-negative integers `nums`. For each integer in `nums`, you must find its respective **second greater** integer.

The **second greater** integer of `nums[i]` is `nums[j]` such that:


	
- `j > i`
	
- `nums[j] > nums[i]`
	
- There exists **exactly one** index `k` such that `nums[k] > nums[i]` and `i < k < j`.


If there is no such `nums[j]`, the second greater integer is considered to be `-1`.


	
- For example, in the array `[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the second greater integer of `1` is `4`, `2` is `3`, and that of `3` and `4` is `-1`.


Return** an integer array **`answer`**, where **`answer[i]`** is the second greater integer of **`nums[i]`**.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,4,0,9,6]
Output: [9,6,6,-1,-1]
Explanation:
0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.
1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.
2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to the right of 0.
3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
Thus, we return [9,6,6,-1,-1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation:
We return [-1,-1] since neither integer has any integer greater than it.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
	
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var secondGreaterElement = function(nums) {
    var res = Array(nums.length).fill(-1);
    var stack1 = []; // first greater integer
    var stack2 = []; // second greater integer
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        while (stack2.length && nums[i] > nums[stack2[stack2.length - 1]]) {
            res[stack2.pop()] = nums[i];
        }
        var tempArr = [];
        while (stack1.length && nums[i] > nums[stack1[stack1.length - 1]]) {
            tempArr.unshift(stack1.pop());
        }
        stack2.push(...tempArr);
        stack1.push(i);
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
