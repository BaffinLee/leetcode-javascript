# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

## Problem

Given the integers `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high`, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:


	
- Append the character `'0'` `zero` times.
	
- Append the character `'1'` `one` times.


This can be performed any number of times.

A **good** string is a string constructed by the above process having a **length** between `low` and `high` (**inclusive**).

Return **the number of **different** good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties.** Since the answer can be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: 
One possible valid good string is "011". 
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= low <= high <= 105`
	
- `1 <= zero, one <= low`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} low
 * @param {number} high
 * @param {number} zero
 * @param {number} one
 * @return {number}
 */
var countGoodStrings = function(low, high, zero, one) {
    var mod = Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;
    var dp = new Array(high + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (var i = Math.min(zero, one); i <= high; i++) {
        if (i >= zero) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % mod;
        }
        if (i >= one) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % mod;
        }
    }
    var res = 0;
    for (var i = low; i <= high; i++) {
        res = (res + dp[i]) % mod;
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

`dp[i]` means, for string length `i`, has `dp[i]` kinds of different good strings.

`dp[i] = dp[i - zero] + dp[i - one]`

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
