## Problem

You have `k` bags. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `weights` where `weights[i]` is the weight of the `ith` marble. You are also given the integer `k.`

Divide the marbles into the `k` bags according to the following rules:


	
- No bag is empty.
	
- If the `ith` marble and `jth` marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the `ith` and `jth` indices should also be in that same bag.
	
- If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from `i` to `j` inclusively, then the cost of the bag is `weights[i] + weights[j]`.


The **score** after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the `k` bags.

Return **the **difference** between the **maximum** and **minimum** scores among marble distributions**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. 
Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= k <= weights.length <= 105`
	
- `1 <= weights[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} weights
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var putMarbles = function(weights, k) {
    var arr = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < weights.length - 1; i++) {
        arr.push(weights[i] + weights[i + 1]);
    }
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var min = arr.slice(0, k - 1).reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    var max = arr.slice(arr.length - k + 1).reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    return max - min;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(nlog(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).
