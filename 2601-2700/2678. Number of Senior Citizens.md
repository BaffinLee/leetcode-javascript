## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `details`. Each element of `details` provides information about a given passenger compressed into a string of length `15`. The system is such that:


	
- The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
	
- The next character denotes the gender of the person.
	
- The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
	
- The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.


Return **the number of passengers who are **strictly ****more than 60 years old**.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: details = ["7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010"]
Output: 2
Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: details = ["1313579440F2036","2921522980M5644"]
Output: 0
Explanation: None of the passengers are older than 60.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= details.length <= 100`
	
- `details[i].length == 15`
	
- `details[i] consists of digits from '0' to '9'.`
	
- `details[i][10] is either 'M' or 'F' or 'O'.`
	
- The phone numbers and seat numbers of the passengers are distinct.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} details
 * @return {number}
 */
var countSeniors = function(details) {
    var count = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < details.length; i++) {
        if (details[i][11] > '6' || (details[i][11] === '6' && details[i][12] > '0')) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
