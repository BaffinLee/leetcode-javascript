## Problem

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the prices of various chocolates in a store. You are also given a single integer `money`, which represents your initial amount of money.

You must buy **exactly** two chocolates in such a way that you still have some **non-negative** leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.

Return **the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates**. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return `money`. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [1,2,2], money = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [3,2,3], money = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot buy 2 chocolates without going in debt, so we return 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= prices.length <= 50`
	
- `1 <= prices[i] <= 100`
	
- `1 <= money <= 100`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @param {number} money
 * @return {number}
 */
var buyChoco = function(prices, money) {
    var minPrice = 0;
    var secondMinPrice = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (minPrice === 0 || prices[i] < minPrice) {
            secondMinPrice = minPrice;
            minPrice = prices[i];
        } else if (secondMinPrice === 0 || prices[i] < secondMinPrice) {
            secondMinPrice = prices[i];
        }
    }
    return (minPrice !== 0 && secondMinPrice !== 0 && secondMinPrice + minPrice <= money)
        ? money - (secondMinPrice + minPrice)
        : money;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
