## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a dictionary of words `dictionary`. You have to break `s` into one or more **non-overlapping** substrings such that each substring is present in `dictionary`. There may be some **extra characters** in `s` which are not present in any of the substrings.

Return **the **minimum** number of extra characters left over if you break up **`s`** optimally.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.

```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 50`
	
- `1 <= dictionary.length <= 50`
	
- `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50`
	
- `dictionary[i]` and `s` consists of only lowercase English letters
	
- `dictionary` contains distinct words



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} dictionary
 * @return {number}
 */
var minExtraChar = function(s, dictionary) {
    var map = dictionary.reduce((res, item) => {
        res[item] = 1;
        return res;
    }, {});
    var dp = Array(s.length);
    for (var i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        dp[i] = (dp[i + 1] || 0) + 1;
        var str = '';
        for (var j = i; j < s.length; j++) {
            str += s[j];
            if (map[str]) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j + 1] || 0);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[0];
};
```

**Explain:**

Bottom-up dynamic programming.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n ^ 2).
* Space complexity : O(n).
