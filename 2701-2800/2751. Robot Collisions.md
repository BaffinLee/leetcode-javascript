# 2751. Robot Collisions

- Difficulty: Hard.

## Problem

There are `n` **1-indexed** robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given **0-indexed** integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either **'L'** for **left** or **'R'** for **right**). All integers in `positions` are **unique**.

All robots start moving on the line** simultaneously** at the **same speed **in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will **collide**.

If two robots collide, the robot with **lower health** is **removed** from the line, and the health of the other robot **decreases** **by one**. The surviving robot continues in the **same** direction it was going. If both robots have the **same** health, they are both** **removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the **health** of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same **order **that the robots were given,** **i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return **an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.**

**Note:** The positions may be unsorted.

 

 
Example 1:


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516011718-12.png)


```
Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].
```

Example 2:


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516004433-7.png)


```
Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].
```

Example 3:


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516005114-9.png)


```
Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105`
	
- `1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109`
	
- `directions[i] == 'L'` or `directions[i] == 'R'`
	
- All values in `positions` are distinct



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} positions
 * @param {number[]} healths
 * @param {string} directions
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var survivedRobotsHealths = function(positions, healths, directions) {
    var res = [];
    var stack = [];
    var robots = positions.map((p, i) => [p, healths[i], directions[i], i]).sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    for (var i = 0; i < robots.length; i++) {
        var robot = robots[i];
        if (robot[2] === 'R') {
            stack.push(robot);
            continue;
        }
        while (robot[1] > 0 && stack.length) {
            if (stack[stack.length - 1][1] < robot[1]) {
                stack.pop();
                robot[1] -= 1;
            } else if (stack[stack.length - 1][1] === robot[1]) {
                stack.pop();
                robot[1] = 0;
            } else {
                stack[stack.length - 1][1] -= 1;
                robot[1] = 0;
            }
        }
        if (robot[1] > 0) {
            res.push(robot);
        }
    }
    res.push(...stack);
    return res.sort((a, b) => a[3] - b[3]).map(a => a[1]);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).
