## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array `usageLimits` of length `n`.

Your task is to create **groups** using numbers from `0` to `n - 1`, ensuring that each number, `i`, is used no more than `usageLimits[i]` times in total **across all groups**. You must also satisfy the following conditions:


	
- Each group must consist of **distinct **numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
	
- Each group (except the first one) must have a length **strictly greater** than the previous group.


Return **an integer denoting the **maximum** number of groups you can create while satisfying these conditions.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: usageLimits = [1,2,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, we can use 0 at most once, 1 at most twice, and 2 at most five times.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is: 
Group 1 contains the number [2].
Group 2 contains the numbers [1,2].
Group 3 contains the numbers [0,1,2]. 
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 3. 
So, the output is 3. 
```

Example 2:

```
Input: usageLimits = [2,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, we can use 0 at most twice, 1 at most once, and 2 at most twice.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is:
Group 1 contains the number [0].
Group 2 contains the numbers [1,2].
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 2.
So, the output is 2. 
```

Example 3:

```
Input: usageLimits = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we can use both 0 and 1 at most once.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is:
Group 1 contains the number [0].
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 1.
So, the output is 1. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= usageLimits.length <= 105`
	
- `1 <= usageLimits[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} usageLimits
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxIncreasingGroups = function(usageLimits) {
    var count = 0;
    var num = 0;
    var minCount = 1;
    usageLimits.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    for (var i = 0; i < usageLimits.length; i++) {
        count += usageLimits[i];
        if (count >= minCount) {
            num++;
            minCount += num + 1;
        }
    }
    return num;
};
```
