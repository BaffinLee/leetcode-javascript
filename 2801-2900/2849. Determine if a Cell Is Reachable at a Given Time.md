## Problem

You are given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `fx`, `fy`, and a **non-negative** integer `t`.

In an infinite 2D grid, you start at the cell `(sx, sy)`. Each second, you **must** move to any of its adjacent cells.

Return `true` **if you can reach cell **`(fx, fy)` **after** exactly**** `t` ****seconds****, **or** `false` **otherwise**.

A cell's **adjacent cells** are the 8 cells around it that share at least one corner with it. You can visit the same cell several times.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/05/example2.svg)

```
Input: sx = 2, sy = 4, fx = 7, fy = 7, t = 6
Output: true
Explanation: Starting at cell (2, 4), we can reach cell (7, 7) in exactly 6 seconds by going through the cells depicted in the picture above. 
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/05/example1.svg)

```
Input: sx = 3, sy = 1, fx = 7, fy = 3, t = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Starting at cell (3, 1), it takes at least 4 seconds to reach cell (7, 3) by going through the cells depicted in the picture above. Hence, we cannot reach cell (7, 3) at the third second.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= sx, sy, fx, fy <= 109`
	
- `0 <= t <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} sx
 * @param {number} sy
 * @param {number} fx
 * @param {number} fy
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isReachableAtTime = function(sx, sy, fx, fy, t) {
    const x = Math.abs(sx - fx);
    const y = Math.abs(sy - fy);
    if (sx === fx && sy === fy && t === 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return Math.max(x, y) <= t;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(1).
* Space complexity : O(1).
