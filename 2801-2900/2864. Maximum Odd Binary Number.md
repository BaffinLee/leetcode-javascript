## Problem

You are given a **binary** string `s` that contains at least one `'1'`.

You have to **rearrange** the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the **maximum odd binary number** that can be created from this combination.

Return **a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.**

**Note **that the resulting string **can** have leading zeros.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
	
- `s` consists only of `'0'` and `'1'`.
	
- `s` contains at least one `'1'`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var maximumOddBinaryNumber = function(s) {
    var numOfOnes = s.split('').reduce((sum, num) => sum + Number(num), 0);
    return '1'.repeat(numOfOnes - 1) + '0'.repeat(s.length - numOfOnes) + '1';
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
