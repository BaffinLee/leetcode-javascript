## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array **any** number of times:


	
- Choose **two** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them from the array.
	
- Choose **three** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them from the array.


Return **the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array empty, or **`-1`** if it is not possible**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].
It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to empty the array.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
	
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minOperations = function(nums) {
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        var num = nums[i];
        map[num] = map[num] || 0;
        map[num] += 1;
    }
    var keys = Object.keys(map);
    var res = 0;
    for (var j = 0; j < keys.length; j++) {
        var num = keys[j];
        if (map[num] === 1) return -1;
        res += Math.ceil(map[num] / 3);
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
