## Problem

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by *exactly* one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return **a list of all **MHTs'** root labels**. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
	
- `edges.length == n - 1`
	
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
	
- `ai != bi`
	
- All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
	
- The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findMinHeightTrees = function(n, edges) {
    if (!edges.length) return [0];
    var map = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => new Map());
    for (var i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        map[edges[i][0]].set(edges[i][1], true);
        map[edges[i][1]].set(edges[i][0], true);
    }
    var arr = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (map[i].size === 1) {
            arr.push(i);
        }
    }
    while (n > 2) {
        n -= arr.length;
        var newArr = [];
        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            var j = Array.from(map[arr[i]].keys())[0];
            map[j].delete(arr[i]);
            if (map[j].size === 1) {
                newArr.push(j);
            }
        }
        arr = newArr;
    }
    return arr;
};
```

**Explain:**

Delete every leaf untill there is only one or two nodes.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
