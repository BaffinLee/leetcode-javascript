## Problem

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.


	
- For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.


You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
	
- `tickets[i].length == 2`
	
- `fromi.length == 3`
	
- `toi.length == 3`
	
- `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
	
- `fromi != toi`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} tickets
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findItinerary = function(tickets) {
    tickets.sort((a, b) => (a[1] === b[1] ? 0 : (a[1] < b[1] ? -1 : 1)));

    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {
      if (!map[tickets[i][0]]) map[tickets[i][0]] = [];
      map[tickets[i][0]].push(tickets[i][1]);
    }

    console.log(map, tickets);

  var itinerary = [];
  dfs('JFK', map, itinerary);
  return itinerary.reverse();
};

var dfs = function(airport, map, itinerary) {
  while (map[airport]?.length) {
    dfs(map[airport].shift(), map, itinerary);
  }
  itinerary.push(airport);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(n).
