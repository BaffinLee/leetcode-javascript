## Problem

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return **an array of their intersection**. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
	
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`


 
**Follow up:**


	
- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
	
- What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
	
- What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var intersect = function(nums1, nums2) {
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
        map[nums1[i]] = (map[nums1[i]] || 0) + 1;
    }
    var res = [];
    for (var j = 0; j < nums2.length; j++) {
        if (map[nums2[j]]) {
            map[nums2[j]]--;
            res.push(nums2[j]);
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n + m).
* Space complexity : O(n + m).
