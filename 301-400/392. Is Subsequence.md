## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true`** if **`s`** is a **subsequence** of **`t`**, or **`false`** otherwise**.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

 
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```
 
**Constraints:**


	
- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
	
- `0 <= t.length <= 104`
	
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.


 
**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 109`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {
    var j = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        while (s[i] !== t[j] && j < t.length - 1) j++;
        if (s[i] != t[j]) return false;
        j++;
    }
    return true;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
