## Problem

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order**, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be `1` unit.

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= stones.length <= 2000`
	
- `0 <= stones[i] <= 231 - 1`
	
- `stones[0] == 0`
	
- `stones` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} stones
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canCross = function(stones) {
    return stones[1] - stones[0] === 1
        ? helper(stones, 1, 1, Array(stones.length).fill(0).map(() => ({})))
        : false;
};

var helper = function(stones, i, k, dp) {
    if (dp[i][k]) return false;
    for (var j = i + 1; j < stones.length; j++) {
        var diff = stones[j] - stones[i];
        if (diff > k + 1) break;
        if (diff < k - 1) continue;
        if (helper(stones, j, diff, dp)) return true;
    }
    dp[i][k] = true;
    return i === stones.length - 1;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n ^ 2).
* Space complexity : O(n ^ 2).
