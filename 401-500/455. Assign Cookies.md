## Problem

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104`
	
- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
	
- `1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} g
 * @param {number[]} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var findContentChildren = function(g, s) {
    g.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    s.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var j = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < g.length; i++) {
        while (s[j] < g[i] && j < s.length) j++;
        if (j === s.length) return i;
        j++;
    }
    return g.length;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(1).
