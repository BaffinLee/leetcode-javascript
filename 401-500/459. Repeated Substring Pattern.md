## Problem

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
	
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var repeatedSubstringPattern = function(s) {
    return `${s}${s}`.slice(1, s.length * 2 - 1).includes(s);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
