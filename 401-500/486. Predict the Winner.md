## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
	
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 107`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var PredictTheWinner = function(nums) {
    return maxDiff(nums, 0, nums.length - 1) >= 0;
};

var maxDiff = function(nums, left, right) {
    if (left === right) return nums[left];
    return Math.max(
        nums[left] - maxDiff(nums, left + 1, right),
        nums[right] - maxDiff(nums, left, right - 1),
    );
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n ^ 2).
* Space complexity : O(n ^ 2).
