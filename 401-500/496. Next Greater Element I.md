## Problem

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return **an array **`ans`** of length **`nums1.length`** such that **`ans[i]`** is the **next greater element** as described above.**

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
	
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104`
	
- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.
	
- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.


 
**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var nextGreaterElement = function(nums1, nums2) {
    var map = {};
    var stack = [];
    for (var i = nums2.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] <= nums2[i]) stack.pop();
        map[nums2[i]] = stack.length ? stack[stack.length - 1] : -1;
        stack.push(nums2[i]);
    }
    return nums1.map(num => map[num]);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
