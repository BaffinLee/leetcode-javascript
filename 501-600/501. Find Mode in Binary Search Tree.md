## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return **all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it**.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:


	
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
	
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
	
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


 
Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
	
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`


 
**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findMode = function(root) {
    var max = 0;
    var res = [];
    var num = 0.1;
    var count = 0;
    var update = () => {
        if (count === max) {
            res.push(num);
        } else if (count > max) {
            max = count;
            res = [num];
        }
    };
    preOrder(root, node => {
        if (node.val === num) {
            count += 1;
        } else {
            update();
            num = node.val;
            count = 1;
        }
    });
    update();
    return res;
};

var preOrder = function(root, visit) {
    root.left && preOrder(root.left, visit);
    visit(root);
    root.right && preOrder(root.right, visit);
};
```

**Explain:**

Pre-order traversal visiting can visit binary search tree's nodes value by ascending order.

Imaging you have an ordered array, find the most consecutive number(s).

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
