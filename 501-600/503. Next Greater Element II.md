## Problem

Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return **the **next greater number** for every element in** `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
	
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var nextGreaterElements = function(nums) {
    var map = Array(nums.length);
    var stack = [];
    for (var i = nums.length * 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        var index = i % nums.length;
        while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] <= nums[index]) stack.pop();
        map[index] = stack.length ? stack[stack.length - 1] : -1;
        stack.push(nums[index]);
    }
    return map;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
