## Problem

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **"Road to Freedom"** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **"Freedom Trail Ring"** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return **the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword**.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `"12:00"` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `"12:00"` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:


	
- You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `"12:00"` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
	
- If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `"12:00"` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.


 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/ring.jpg)

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "godding"
Output: 13
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
	
- `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
	
- It is guaranteed that `key` could always be spelled by rotating `ring`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} ring
 * @param {string} key
 * @return {number}
 */
var findRotateSteps = function(ring, key) {
    var next = function(i) {
        return i === ring.length - 1 ? 0 : i + 1;
    };
    var prev = function(i) {
        return i === 0 ? ring.length - 1 : i - 1;
    };
    var dp = Array(ring.length).fill(0).map(() => Array(key.length));
    var dfs = function(i, j) {
        if (j === key.length) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] !== undefined) return dp[i][j];
        if (ring[i] === key[j]) {
            dp[i][j] = 1 + dfs(i, j + 1);
            return dp[i][j];
        }
        var nextI = next(i);
        while (ring[nextI] !== key[j]) nextI = next(nextI);
        var prevI = prev(i);
        while (ring[prevI] !== key[j]) prevI = prev(prevI);
        dp[i][j] = Math.min(
            ((nextI - i + ring.length) % ring.length) + dfs(nextI, j),
            ((i - prevI + ring.length) % ring.length) + dfs(prevI, j),
        );
        return dp[i][j];
    };
    return dfs(0, 0);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * n * m).
* Space complexity : O(n * m).
