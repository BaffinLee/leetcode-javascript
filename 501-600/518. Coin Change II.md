## Problem

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return **the number of combinations that make up that amount**. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
Output: 1
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
	
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
	
- All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
	
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} amount
 * @param {number[]} coins
 * @return {number}
 */
var change = function(amount, coins) {
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    return helper(amount, coins, Array(coins.length + 1).fill(0).map(() => []));
};

var helper = function(amount, coins, dp) {
    if (amount === 0) return 1;
    if (dp[coins.length][amount] !== undefined) return dp[coins.length][amount];
    var res = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
        if (amount >= coins[i]) {
            res += helper(amount - coins[i], coins.slice(i), dp);
        }
    }
    dp[coins.length][amount] = res;
    return res;
};
```
**Explain:**

1. sort `coins` array, to avoid duplicate answer
2. `f(5, [5,2,1]) = f(0, [5,2,1]) + f(3, [2,1]) + f(4, [1])`
3. `f(0, []) = 1`
4. cache every compute so that we only compute same case once

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * m).
* Space complexity : O(n * m).
