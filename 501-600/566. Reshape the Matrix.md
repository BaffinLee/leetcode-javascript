## Problem

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two **positive** integers **r** and **c** representing the **row** number and **column** number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same **row-traversing** order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
```

**Note:**

- The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
- The given r and c are all positive.

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} nums
 * @param {number} r
 * @param {number} c
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var matrixReshape = function(nums, r, c) {
  var m = nums.length;
  var n = nums[0].length;
  
  if (m * n !== r * c) return nums;
  
  var res = Array(r).fill(0).map(_ => Array(c));
  var num = r * c;
  
  for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    res[Math.floor(i / c)][i % c] = nums[Math.floor(i / n)][i % n];
  }

  return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(r*c).
* Space complexity : O(r*c).
