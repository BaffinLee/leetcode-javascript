## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
	
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string}
 */
var tree2str = function(root) {
    if (!root) return '';
    var res = `${root.val}`;
    if (root.left || root.right) res += `(${tree2str(root.left)})`;
    if (root.right) res += `(${tree2str(root.right)})`;
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
