# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

- Difficulty: Easy.
- Related Topics: Array, Dynamic Programming.
- Similar Questions: Climbing Stairs.

## Problem

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return **the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
	
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCostClimbingStairs = function(cost) {
    var prevOne = 0;
    var prevTwo = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i <= cost.length; i++) {
        var min = Math.min(
            prevOne + (cost[i - 1] || 0),
            prevTwo + (cost[i - 2] || 0),
        );
        prevTwo = prevOne;
        prevOne = min;
    }
    return prevOne;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
