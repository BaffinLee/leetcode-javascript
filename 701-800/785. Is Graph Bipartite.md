## Problem

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:


	
- There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
	
- There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
	
- If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
	
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.


A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true`** if and only if it is **bipartite****.

 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi2.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `graph.length == n`
	
- `1 <= n <= 100`
	
- `0 <= graph[u].length < n`
	
- `0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1`
	
- `graph[u]` does not contain `u`.
	
- All the values of `graph[u]` are **unique**.
	
- If `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isBipartite = function(graph) {
    var map = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
        if (!dfs(graph, map, i)) return false;
    }
    return true;
};

var dfs = function(graph, map, i, group) {
    if (map[i]) return !group || group === map[i];
    map[i] = group || 1;
    for (var j = 0; j < graph[i].length; j++) {
        if (!dfs(graph, map, graph[i][j], map[i] === 1 ? 2 : 1)) return false;
    }
    return true;
};
```

**Explain:**

DFS with memorize.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
