## Problem

There is a directed graph of `n` nodes with each node labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `graph` where `graph[i]` is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node `i`, meaning there is an edge from node `i` to each node in `graph[i]`.

A node is a **terminal node** if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a **safe node** if every possible path starting from that node leads to a **terminal node** (or another safe node).

Return **an array containing all the **safe nodes** of the graph**. The answer should be sorted in **ascending** order.

 
Example 1:

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/17/picture1.png)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `n == graph.length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 104`
	
- `0 <= graph[i].length <= n`
	
- `0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1`
	
- `graph[i]` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
	
- The graph may contain self-loops.
	
- The number of edges in the graph will be in the range `[1, 4 * 104]`.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var eventualSafeNodes = function(graph) {
    var map = Array(graph.length);
    var path = Array(graph.length);
    var res = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
        if (isSafeNode(i, graph, map, path)) {
            res.push(i);
        }
    }
    return res;
};

var isSafeNode = function(i, graph, map, path) {
    if (graph[i].length === 0 || map[i] === 1) return true;
    if (map[i] === 2 || path[i] === 1) return false;
    path[i] = 1;
    for (var j = 0; j < graph[i].length; j++) {
        var index = graph[i][j];
        if (!isSafeNode(index, graph, map, path)) {
            path[i] = 0;
            map[i] = 2;
            return false;
        }
    }
    path[i] = 0;
    map[i] = 1;
    return true;
};
```

**Explain:**

DFS (Depth First Search).

**Complexity:**

`n` nodes, `m` edges.

* Time complexity : O(n + m).
* Space complexity : O(n + m).
