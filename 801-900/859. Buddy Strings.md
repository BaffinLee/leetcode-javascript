## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true`** if you can swap two letters in **`s`** so the result is equal to **`goal`**, otherwise, return **`false`**.**

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.


	
- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.


 
Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104`
	
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} goal
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var buddyStrings = function(s, goal) {
    if (s.length !== goal.length) return false;
    if (s === goal) {
        const map = {};
        return !!Array.from(s).find(char => {
            map[char] = (map[char] || 0) + 1;
            return map[char] === 2;
        });
    }
    var diff = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] !== goal[i]) {
            if (diff.length >= 2) return false;
            diff.push(i);
        }
    }
    return diff.length === 2 && s[diff[0]] === goal[diff[1]] && s[diff[1]] === goal[diff[0]];
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
