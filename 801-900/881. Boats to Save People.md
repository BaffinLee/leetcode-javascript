## Problem

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return **the minimum number of boats to carry every given person**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

Example 2:

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

Example 3:

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
	
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} people
 * @param {number} limit
 * @return {number}
 */
var numRescueBoats = function(people, limit) {
    people.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    var left = 0;
    var right = people.length - 1;
    var res = 0;
    while (left <= right) {
        res++;
        if (left === right) {
            break;
        }
        if (people[left] + people[right] > limit) {
            right--;
        } else {
            right--;
            left++;
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n * log(n)).
* Space complexity : O(1).
