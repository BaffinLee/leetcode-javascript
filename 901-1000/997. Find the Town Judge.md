## Problem

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:


	
- The town judge trusts nobody.
	
- Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
	
- There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.


You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`. If a trust relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return **the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return **`-1`** otherwise**.

 
Example 1:

```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
	
- `0 <= trust.length <= 104`
	
- `trust[i].length == 2`
	
- All the pairs of `trust` are **unique**.
	
- `ai != bi`
	
- `1 <= ai, bi <= n`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
 */
var findJudge = function(n, trust) {
    var map = Array(n + 1).fill(0).map(() => [0, 0]);
    for (var i = 0; i < trust.length; i++) {
        map[trust[i][0]][0] += 1;
        map[trust[i][1]][1] += 1;
    }
    for (var j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (map[j][0] === 0 && map[j][1] === n - 1) return j;
    }
    return -1;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
