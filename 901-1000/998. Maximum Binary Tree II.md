## Problem

A **maximum tree** is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.

You are given the `root` of a maximum binary tree and an integer `val`.

Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from a list `a` (`root = Construct(a)`) recursively with the following `Construct(a)` routine:


	
- If `a` is empty, return `null`.
	
- Otherwise, let `a[i]` be the largest element of `a`. Create a `root` node with the value `a[i]`.
	
- The left child of `root` will be `Construct([a[0], a[1], ..., a[i - 1]])`.
	
- The right child of `root` will be `Construct([a[i + 1], a[i + 2], ..., a[a.length - 1]])`.
	
- Return `root`.


Note that we were not given `a` directly, only a root node `root = Construct(a)`.

Suppose `b` is a copy of `a` with the value `val` appended to it. It is guaranteed that `b` has unique values.

Return `Construct(b)`.

```
Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
Explanation: a = [1,4,2,3], b = [1,4,2,3,5]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]
Explanation: a = [2,1,5,4], b = [2,1,5,4,3]
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/09/maxtree3.JPG)

```
Input: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,3]
Explanation: a = [2,1,5,3], b = [2,1,5,3,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
	
- All the values of the tree are **unique**.
	
- `1 <= val <= 100`



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} val
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var insertIntoMaxTree = function(root, val) {
    var nodes = [];
    var now = root;
    while (now) {
        nodes.push(now);
        now = now.right;
    }
    for (var i = nodes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nodes[i].val < val) continue;
        nodes[i].right = new TreeNode(val, nodes[i].right);
        return root;
    }
    return new TreeNode(val, root);
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
